  summary: Destroy family
  description: Destroys a family.
  parameters:
    - name: people_ids_json
      description: |
        The id of the person belonging to a family you'd like to destroy. This
        does not delete any people, it simply removes their association with
        the family. Only one person id from the family is needed (e.g. if you
        specify one person in a family of seven, all 7 people are removed from
        the family). Passing in multiple people ids (where those people are in
        different families) allows developers to destroy multiple families in a
        single call.
