  summary: Add attendance record
  description: >
    Add an attendance record for a profile to an individual event instance.
  parameters:
    - name: direction
      description: |
        Set whether someone is being checked into or out of an event. Note that
        checking "out" is not the same as "removing" the attendance record.
        Checking out refers to recording a timestamp of when the individual
        left the event.

        If the check "out" call is made on a profile that is not already
        checked in, a new attendance record will be created that has a checked
        in time that matches the checked out time.

        The check out command will work even if the event's settings aren't set
        to enable check out (the setting simply controls the Breeze check in
        user interface for the event which the API bypasses).
